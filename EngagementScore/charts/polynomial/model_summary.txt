Polynomial Regression Model for User Engagement Prediction
==========================================

1. Data Preprocessing Steps:
   - Converted joinedDate to datetime
   - Created days_since_joining feature
   - Counted items in joinedCourses, skills, and desired_skills
   - Calculated overlaps between different skill categories
   - Added derived features for learning progress and effectiveness

2. Features Used:
   - days_since_joining
   - num_joined_courses
   - num_skills
   - num_desired_skills
   - skills_courses_overlap
   - desired_courses_overlap
   - skills_desired_overlap
   - course_effectiveness
   - skills_acquisition_rate
   - learning_gap
   - isVerified

3. Best Model Parameters:
   - classifier__C: 10
   - classifier__solver: lbfgs
   - polynomial__degree: 2

4. Evaluation Metrics:
   - Accuracy: 0.9572
   - Precision: 0.9585
   - Recall: 0.9572
   - F1 Score: 0.9571
   - RMSE: 0.3262

5. Summary of Polynomial Features:
   - Total number of features after polynomial transformation: 78
   - Original features: 11
   - Polynomial degree used: 2

6. Model Interpretation:
   - The polynomial regression approach allows for modeling non-linear relationships
   - Higher degree polynomials can capture more complex patterns, but may overfit
   - The best degree found through cross-validation balances complexity and generalization
