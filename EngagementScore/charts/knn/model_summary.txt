KNN Model for User Engagement Prediction
=======================================

1. Data Preprocessing Steps:
   - Converted joinedDate to datetime
   - Created days_since_joining feature
   - Counted items in joinedCourses, skills, and desired_skills
   - Calculated overlaps between different skill categories
   - Added derived features for learning progress and effectiveness

2. Features Used:
   - days_since_joining
   - num_joined_courses
   - num_skills
   - num_desired_skills
   - skills_courses_overlap
   - desired_courses_overlap
   - skills_desired_overlap
   - course_effectiveness
   - skills_acquisition_rate
   - learning_gap
